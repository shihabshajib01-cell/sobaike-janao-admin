# Sobai Ke Janao Admin Panel

Administration and operational management interface for the **Sobai Ke Janao** civic reporting and community engagement platform.

---

## Overview

Sobai Ke Janao Admin Panel provides municipal administrators, operations teams, and moderators with tools to oversee citizen complaints, moderate public community feed posts, dispatch and track official department responses, manage category taxonomies, visualize geographic complaint distributions, monitor user roles and permissions, review administrative audit trails, and configure system preferences.

---

## Features

- **Dashboard & Overview**: Real-time summary metrics of total, pending, resolved, and active complaints, status distributions, category summaries, and recent activity logs.
- **Complaint Management**: Comprehensive complaint registry with tabular and mobile-optimized card views, multi-criteria filtering (status, ward, category, priority), detail inspection drawer with timeline history, and status progression workflows.
- **Feed Moderation**: Community feed moderation module supporting dual-state workflows (`unpublished` and `published`), content review, title/description editing, and feed publishing/unpublishing actions.
- **Response Management**: Official department responses workflow with status filtering, response templates, verification badges, and resolution logging.
- **Category Management**: Hierarchical categorization for civic issues with category and subcategory creation, editing, and icon management.
- **Interactive Map View**: Geographic mapping of reported issues with status-coded markers, zone/ward boundaries, and interactive detail popups.
- **Users & Permissions**: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) directory supporting Admin, Moderator, and Officer roles with permission management.
- **Operational Analytics**: Visual charts for complaint trends, resolution time averages, ward-level heatmaps, and category breakdowns.
- **Audit Logs**: Immutable timeline of administrative actions, actor identifications, IP logs, and change diffs.
- **System Settings & Localization**: Complete dual-language support (**English** & **Bengali**) with instant language switching and system/light/dark theme toggles.
- **Resilient Data Architecture**: Transparent service layer featuring real API transport with automatic fallback to client-side mock storage during network failure or offline usage.
